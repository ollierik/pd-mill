mill - highly efficient granular synthesizer for Pure data
==========================================================

Oldies but goodies. Unmaintained non-commented hack. It is crudely multi-threaded, and optimised only for speed.

But hey, it works out of the box on Mac and Linux. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.
To build, run 'make' in the directory.
